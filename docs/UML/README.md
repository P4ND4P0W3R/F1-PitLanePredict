# UML Project

## In this directory, you will find the [UML project report](https://github.com/P4ND4P0W3R/S5M-AWP-Project/blob/main/docs/UML/S5M-UML-PROJECT-REPORT%20-%20Paul%20HU,%20Antoine%20DUPONT,%20Alexandre%20GUILLOIS.pdf) as well as all the [UML diagrams](Diagrams/) that we have created for this project respecting the following list of requirements

## Required Project Diagrams

### At the beginning

- [x] [ER + table structure diagram](Diagrams/ER%20+%20table%20structure%20diagrams/) for the database
- [x] [Gantt diagram (planned)](Diagrams/Gantt%20diagrams/)

### Minimum one diagram per member

- [x] [Use case diagram](Diagrams/Use%20case%20diagrams/) (Who can access and what functions)
- [x] [Activity diagram](Diagrams/Activity%20diagrams/) (Some processes from the user perspective)
- [x] [Wireframes](Diagrams/Wireframes/) (UI sketches)

- [x] [Component diagram](Diagrams/Component%20diagrams/) (The big modules that the system will have)
- [x] [Sequence diagram](Diagrams/Sequence%20diagrams/) (Some processes from the code perspective)
  
### At the very end

- [x] [Gantt diagram (actual, signaling who worked where)](Diagrams/Gantt%20diagrams/)
- [x] [Class diagram](Diagrams/Class%20diagram/) (can be auto generated + class relations added manually ... From JS code, auto-generation is tricky ... )
