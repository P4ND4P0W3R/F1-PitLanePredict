# UML Project

## In this directory, you will find the [UML project report](https://github.com/P4ND4P0W3R/S5M-AWP-Project/blob/8c08b94368dd3feb76883029afb6991f950908f4/UML/UML%20Homework%202%20-%20Paul%20HU,%20Antoine%20DUPONT%20&%20Alexandre%20GUILLOIS.pdf) as well as all the [UML diagrams](Diagrams/) that we have created for this project respecting the following list of requirements

*EACH FILE STARTS WITH "[XX]" IT CORRESPONDS TO THE AUTHORS INITIALS<br>[PH] = Paul HU, [AD] = Antoine DUPONT, [AG] = Alexandre GUILLOIS*

## Required Project Diagrams

### At the beginning

- [x] [ER + table structure diagram](Diagrams/ER%20+%20table%20structure%20diagram/) for the database
- [ ] [Gantt diagram (planned)](Diagrams/Gantt%20diagrams/)

### Minimum one diagram per member

- [ ] [Use case diagram](Diagrams/Use%20case%20diagrams/) (Who can access and what functions)
- [ ] [Activity diagram](Diagrams/Activity%20diagrams/) (Some processes from the user perspective)
- [x] [Wireframes](Diagrams/Wireframes/) (UI sketches)

- [x] [Component diagram](Diagrams/Component%20diagrams/) (The big modules that the system will have)
- [ ] [Sequence diagram](Diagrams/Sequence%20diagrams/) (Some processes from the code perspective)
  
### At the very end

- [ ] [Gantt diagram (actual, signaling who worked where)](Diagrams/Gantt%20diagrams/)
- [ ] [Class diagram](Diagrams/Class%20diagrams/) (can be auto-generated + class relations added manually ... From JS code, auto-generation is tricky ... )
