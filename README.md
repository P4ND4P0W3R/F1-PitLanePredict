# F1 Pit Lane Predict

## *S5M - Advanced Web Programming - Project*

This project has been realized by Paul ["P4ND4P0W3R"](https://github.com/P4ND4P0W3R) HU, Antoine ["AntoineD01"](https://github.com/AntoineD01) DUPONT and Alexandre ["AlexForex"](https://github.com/AlexForex) GUILLOIS.
It has been realized during our 5th semester, the study abroad semester while at ESSCA in Budapest, Hungary.

We (Paul and Antoine) have been fans of Formula 1 for years and we just started to introduce Alexandre to this wonderful sport and universe. As big fans of Formula 1 since multiple years, we decided to create a project dedicated to this sport.

The topic of this project is a website that allows users to keep track of results during the 2023 F1 Championship. It isn't a complete website, but it is a good start for a project that could be continued in the future.
The focus of our project is to develop a dedicated online platform for Formula 1 fans, providing them with an opportunity to engage with the sport through a betting website. This platform aims to cater to the interests of Formula 1 fans and betting enthusiasts by creating a space where they can explore the sport in a unique manner.

*NOTE: This project has been realized in parallel with the UML Project. To access this project, please see the directory [UML](docs/UML/) and read the [README.md](docs/UML/README.md) file for more information.*

## The code

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

**Note:** You need to run both the client-side and server-side to have a fully working website.

Start Client-side:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Start Server-side:

```sh
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
