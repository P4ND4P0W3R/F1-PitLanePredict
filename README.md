# S5M-AWP-Project

This project has been realized by Paul HU ("P4ND4P0W3R"), Antoine DUPONT ("AntoineD01") and Alexandre GUILLOIS ("AlexForex").
It has been realized during our 5th semester, the study abroad semester while at ESSCA in Budapest, Hungary.

The topic of this project is a website that allows users to keep track of results during the 2023 F1 Championship. It isn't a complete website, but it is a good start for a project that could be continued in the future.
