# Required Project Diagrams

You can find the UML [project report](https://github.com/P4ND4P0W3R/S5M-AWP-Project/blob/8c08b94368dd3feb76883029afb6991f950908f4/UML/UML%20Homework%202%20-%20Paul%20HU,%20Antoine%20DUPONT%20&%20Alexandre%20GUILLOIS.pdf)

## At the beginning

- [ER + table structure diagram](Diagrams/ER%20+%20table%20structure%20diagram/) for the database
- [Gantt diagram (planned)](Diagrams/Gantt%20diagram%20(planned)/)

## Minimum one diagram per member

- [Use case diagram](Diagrams/Use%20case%20diagram/) (Who can access and what functions)
- [Activity diagram](Diagrams/Activity%20diagram/) (Some processes from the user perspective)
- [Wireframes](Diagrams/Wireframes/) (UI sketches)
- [Component diagram](Diagrams/Component%20diagram/) (The big modules that the system will have)
- [Sequence diagram](Diagrams/Sequence%20diagram/) (Some processes from the code perspective)
  
## At the very end

- [Gantt diagram (actual, signaling who worked where)](Diagrams/Gantt%20diagram%20(actual)/)
- [Class diagram](Diagrams/Class%20diagram/) (can be auto-generated + class relations added manually ... From JS code, auto-generation is tricky ... )
